# MNIST Variational Autoencoder

## Overview
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the MNIST dataset. The VAE is a generative model that learns to encode and decode images, allowing for the generation of new images similar to the training data.

## Acknowledgments


The model is from the PyTorch VAE repository that can be found [here](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE) 

The dataset is from the MNIST dataset that can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The theory behind the VAE is from the original paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) by D. P. Kingma and M. Welling.
